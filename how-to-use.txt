How to use:

1) Navigate into the folder (in the command line/ terminal)
2) Run "npm install" to install all required dependencies
3) Run "npm run build" to run the development build script => Keep this process running! It recompiles your files upon changes.
4) Run "npm start" in a new command line/ terminal window => Keep this process running as well, it's your NodeJS server.
